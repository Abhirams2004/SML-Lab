10: A hospital is using a Poisson regression model (a type of GLM) to predict the number of emergency room visits per week based on patient age and medical history. The model is given by: Log(位) =2.5-0.03*Age+0.5*condition where 位 is the expected number of visits per week, Age is the patient's age, and condition is a binary variable (1 if the patient has a chronic condition, 0 otherwise). Interpret the coefficients of Age and condition. What is the expected number of visits per week for a 60-year-old patient with a chronic condition? How would the expected number of visits change if the patient did not have a chronic condition?

import numpy as np

# Poisson regression model parameters
intercept = 2.5
beta_age = -0.03
beta_condition = 0.5

def expected_visits(age, condition):
    log_lambda = intercept + beta_age * age + beta_condition * condition
    lam = np.exp(log_lambda)  # Convert from log(位) to 位
    return lam

# Case 1: 60-year-old with chronic condition (condition=1)
visits_with_condition = expected_visits(60, 1)

# Case 2: 60-year-old without chronic condition (condition=0)
visits_without_condition = expected_visits(60, 0)

print("Expected visits (60 yrs, chronic condition):", visits_with_condition)
print("Expected visits (60 yrs, no chronic condition):", visits_without_condition)
print("Change in expected visits:", visits_with_condition - visits_without_condition)

Output:
Expected visits (60 yrs, chronic condition): 3.320116922736548
Expected visits (60 yrs, no chronic condition): 2.013752707470477
Change in expected visits: 1.306364215266071



















11: A bakery claims that its new cookie recipe is lower in calories compared to the old recipe, which had a mean calorie count of 200. You sample 40 new cookies and find a mean of 190 calories with a standard deviation of 15 calories. Perform a one-tailed t-test to determine if the new recipe has significantly fewer calories at a 5% significance level.
# One-sample one-tailed t-test

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Given data
mu_old = 200   # population mean (old recipe)
n = 40         # sample size
sample_mean = 190
sample_std = 15
alpha = 0.05   # significance level

# Step 1: Compute the t-statistic
t_stat = (sample_mean - mu_old) / (sample_std / np.sqrt(n))

# Step 2: Degrees of freedom
df = n - 1

# Step 3: Compute one-tailed p-value
p_value = stats.t.cdf(t_stat, df=df)  # since it's left-tailed (mean < 200)

# Step 4: Decision
if p_value < alpha:
    decision = "Reject the null hypothesis (New recipe has significantly fewer calories)."
else:
    decision = "Fail to reject the null hypothesis (No significant evidence)."

# Output results
print("One-Sample One-Tailed t-Test")
print("-" * 50)
print(f"Sample Size (n): {n}")
print(f"Sample Mean: {sample_mean}")
print(f"Sample Std Dev: {sample_std}")
print(f"Hypothesized Mean: {mu_old}")
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"Degrees of Freedom: {df}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
print(f"Significance Level (alpha): {alpha}")
print("Conclusion:", decision)







Output:

One-Sample One-Tailed t-Test
--------------------------------------------------
Sample Size (n): 40
Sample Mean: 190
Sample Std Dev: 15
Hypothesized Mean: 200
t-statistic: -4.2164
Degrees of Freedom: 39
p-value: 0.0001
Significance Level (alpha): 0.05
Conclusion: Reject the null hypothesis (New recipe has significantly fewer calories).
